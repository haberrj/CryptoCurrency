# The purpose of the is script is to implement the algorithm for determining investment strategy
# The algorithm with consist of taking the first and second derivative of the respective curves.
# The 1st derivative will provide the user with the speed at which price changes are occurring
# i.e. whether it is moving up, peaking, moving down, or flooring
# The 2nd derivative will provide the user with the acceleration at which the price is changing
# i.e. degree to which it is increasing or decreasing
# Class structures will not be implemented as this meant to be usable functions
